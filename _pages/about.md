I am a phd student at CTU in Prague at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering
(FEE). Currently part of [SAMI](http://sami.fel.cvut.cz/) team, a signal analysis, modelling and interpretation group concerned with fundamental and applied research in _biomedical engineering_.

My professional interests include signal processing, speech, sound and image processing, wireless communication -
physical layer, mobile applications development. Experience in Kotlin, C, C++, Python and Julia programming languages and environment
of MATLAB, Maple.
I‘d like to be involved in developing new tools, methods and approaches as a process
of innovation and improvement.

Among my parsonal interests you can find running, orienteering, cycling, swimming, cross-country skiing, hiking, guitar, analogue
