---

I am a phd student at CTU in Prague at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering
(FEE). Currently part of [SAMI](http://sami.fel.cvut.cz/) team, a signal analysis, modelling and interpretation group concerned with fundamental and applied research in _biomedical engineering_. Working on development and assessment of algorithms for speech features extraction, their implemenation in various determining scenarios and usage for neurodegenerative diseases severity evaluation.

My professional interests include signal processing, speech, sound and image processing, wireless communication -
physical layer, mobile applications development. Experience in Kotlin, C, C++, Python and Julia programming languages and environment
of MATLAB, Maple.
I‘d like to be involved in developing new tools, methods and approaches as a process
of innovation and improvement.

Among my personal interests you can find running, orienteering, cycling, swimming, cross-country skiing, hiking, guitar, analogue
and digital photography, listening to music, PC games and documents design.
